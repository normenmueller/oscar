# Parser

## 0.1.2

### New Features

- Add labels to `query`, `select_element`, and `case_expression` to get more precise listeners. 

### Changes

- Remove `src/main/resources/*.{sh, g4}`.

- Remove `column_alias` and `table_alias`; use `alias` instead

### Bug Fixes

- `case <expression> when <condition> then ...` changed to `case <expression> when <expression> then ...` due to the spec: "In a simple `CASE` expression, Oracle Database searches for the first `WHEN ... THEN` pair for which *`expr` is equal to `comparison_expr`* and returns `return_expr`." I.e. the comparison for equality is implicit. Thanks goes to [Matthias BÃ¼tof](https://www.xing.com/profile/Matthias_Buetof).

### Known Issues

- "Hints" are neglected. As a consequence "empty" `model_rule_clause` is not supported, e.g., 

    ```
    select ... from  ... where ...
    model
    return ALL rows
    MAIN ...
    partition by ( ... )
    dimension by ( ... )
    measures ( ... )
    IGNORE NAV
    rules AUTOMATIC ORDER ( /* a HINT */ )
                           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    ```

- Redundant algebraic signs, e.g.

    ```
    case
      when can_be_used=1
       and CPY = 'D' 
       and TYP_ID = 6 
       and (+ACT_FLG+OPR_ACT_FLG)>0 
           ^^^
      then 1 
      else 0 
    end
    ```

    are not supported
    
- Functions are not disambiguated (Cf. <http://goo.gl/6ucfJD>)

- Format restrictions within Strings are neglected

- Due to Oracle's implicit data conversion some production rules accept `expression` or `subselect` opposed to the spec.

- Object methods are not supported

- Partial context-dependent parsing. Thus no publishing at [Grammars written for ANTLR v4](https://github.com/antlr/grammars-v4) yet.

- To ease parsing `for_update_clause` has been moved to `statement`
