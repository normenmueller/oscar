## New Features

## Changes

- `select`, `subselect`, `query`, `table`, `model_clause`, and `name` improved.

- ~~User defined functions w/o a parameter list and column identifiers overlap. Cf. Oracle (c) SQL 11g R2 specification: "Within a SQL statement, the names of database columns take precedence over the names of functions with no parameters." Thus `value : ... | column | ... | function ...`~~ `function` (in general) vs. `column`: the parser can not distinguish without fail parameterless functions from columns. This disambiguation has to be executed in another step.

## Known Issues

- "Hints" are neglected. As a consequence "empty" `model_rule_clause` is not supported, e.g., 

    ```
    select ... from  ... where ...
    model
    return ALL rows
    MAIN ...
    partition by ( ... )
    dimension by ( ... )
    measures ( ... )
    IGNORE NAV
    rules AUTOMATIC ORDER ( /* a HINT */ )
                           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    ```

* Due to `case when <condition> then ...` expressions like

    ```
    case ... WHEN 'O' THEN 'Y' ...
                  ^^^
    ```
    
    are not supported.

- Redundant algebraic signs, e.g.

    ```
    case
      when can_be_used=1
       and CPY = 'D' 
       and TYP_ID = 6 
       and (+ACT_FLG+OPR_ACT_FLG)>0 
           ^^^
      then 1 
      else 0 
    end
    ```

    are not supported
    
- Functions are not disambiguated (Cf. <http://goo.gl/6ucfJD>)

- Format restrictions within Strings are neglected

- Due to Oracle's implicit data conversion some production rules accept `expression` or `subselect` opposed to the spec.

- Object methods are not supported

- Partial context-dependent parsing. Thus no publishing at [Grammars written for ANTLR v4](https://github.com/antlr/grammars-v4) yet.

- To ease parsing `for_update_clause` has been moved to `statement`
