## Known Issues

- "Hints" are neglected

- Functions are not disambiguated (Cf. goo.gl/6ucfJD)

- Format restrictions within Strings are neglected

- Due to Oracle's implicit data conversion at some production rules `expression` or `select` is allowed opposed to the spec.

- Object methods are not supported

- Partial context-dependent parsing 
  Thus no publishing at [Grammars written for ANTLR v4](https://github.com/antlr/grammars-v4) yet.

- User defined functions w/o a parameter list and column identifiers overlap. Cf. Oracle (c) SQL 11g R2 specification: "Within a SQL statement, the names of database columns take precedence over the names of functions with no parameters." Thus `value : ... | column | ... | function ...`

- To ease parsing `for_update_clause` has been moved to `statement`
